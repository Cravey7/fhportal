```

## Dependency Management Strategies

### 1. Parallel Development
```markdown
## Strategy: Maximize Parallel Work
- Frontend and Backend teams work simultaneously
- Design system developed independently
- Testing integrated throughout development
- Documentation updated continuously

## Implementation:
- Clear API contracts defined early
- Mock data for frontend development
- Shared component library
- Regular integration checkpoints
```

### 2. Dependency Isolation
```markdown
## Strategy: Minimize Cross-Dependencies
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Feature flags for incomplete dependencies
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- Independent deployment capabilities

## Implementation:
- Microservice-style API design
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Database schema versioning
- Environment-specific configurations
```

### 3. Risk Mitigation
```markdown
## Strategy: Reduce Dependency Risks
- Early validation of critical dependencies
- Backup plans for high-risk components
- Regular dependency health checks
- Proactive communication about blockers

## Implementation:
- Weekly dependency review meetings
- Automated dependency monitoring
- Clear escalation procedures
- Regular stakeholder updates
```

## Dependency Tracking Tools

### 1. GitHub Project Board Columns
```
- Blocked (Dependencies not met)
- Ready (Dependencies satisfied)
- In Progress (Active development)
- Review (Waiting for approval)
- Done (Completed and integrated)
```

### 2. Dependency Labels
```
- depends-on-auth
- depends-on-design-system
- depends-on-database
- depends-on-api
- blocks-other-features
- critical-path
```

### 3. Automated Checks
```javascript
// Example dependency validation script
function validateDependencies(feature) {
  const dependencies = getDependencies(feature);
  const blockers = dependencies.filter(dep => !dep.completed);
  
  if (blockers.length > 0) {
    console.warn(`Feature ${feature} blocked by:`, blockers);
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

## Dependency Resolution Process

### 1. Daily Dependency Check
```markdown
## Daily Standup Addition
For each team member:
- What dependencies are you waiting for?
- What dependencies are you providing to others?
- Any new dependencies discovered?
- Any dependency risks identified?
```

### 2. Weekly Dependency Review
```markdown
## Weekly Review Agenda
- Review critical path status
- Identify new dependencies
- Resolve dependency conflicts
- Update timeline based on dependency changes
- Plan parallel work opportunities
```

### 3. Dependency Escalation
```markdown
## Escalation Triggers
- Dependency blocking critical path > 1 day
- Multiple features blocked by same dependency
- External dependency causing delays
- Resource conflicts preventing dependency resolution

## Escalation Process
1. Team Lead attempts resolution
2. Project Manager involvement
3. Stakeholder decision required
4. Timeline/scope adjustment
```
