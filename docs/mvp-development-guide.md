**CRITICAL**: Existing Frontend Horizon database requires refactoring before development

1. **Database Analysis & Refactoring**
   - Review [existing-database-analysis.md](./existing-database-analysis.md) for conflict details
   - Follow [database-refactoring-plan.md](./database-refactoring-plan.md) step-by-step
   - Execute database migrations and schema updates
   - Validate data integrity and RLS policies

2. **Project Setup with Existing Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest fh-portal --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir
   cd fh-portal
   ```
   - Connect to existing Frontend Horizon Supabase project
   - Generate TypeScript types from refactored database
   - Configure environment variables for existing project

3. **Leverage Existing Features**
   - Integrate with existing users table and authentication
   - Utilize existing project management infrastructure
   - Connect to existing time tracking and productivity features
   - Leverage existing CMS and content management system

4. **Create Feature Tracking**
   - Setup GitHub repository and project board
   - Create issues for each MVP feature (adjusted for existing infrastructure)
   - Initialize tracking system from [project-tracking-system.md](./project-tracking-system.md)

### Phase 2: Feature Development (Weeks 2-10)
For each feature in [mvp-features.md](./mvp-features.md):

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

2. **Follow Workflow Template**
   - Use [feature-development-workflow.md](./feature-development-workflow.md)
   - Complete all 6 checklists (Frontend, Backend, Data, Design, UX, Deployment)
   - Track start dates, estimates, and completion times

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Follow [development-standards.md](./development-standards.md)
   - Use [design-system.md](./design-system.md) patterns
   - Run automated tests and validation

### Phase 3: Integration & Launch (Weeks 11-12)
1. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end testing across all features
   - Performance optimization
   - Security review

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Follow deployment checklist
   - Setup monitoring and analytics
   - Launch validation

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Feature Planning
